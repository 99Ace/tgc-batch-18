    <p>SINGAPORE: On Monday (Apr 25), chwee kueh seller Theresa Tan's chye poh (preserved radish) supplier told her that he will increase his prices. </p>

    <p>A tin of chye poh, which she can easily go through in a day, will cost S$158 from May 1, up from S$130 now. </p>

    <p>This additional cost for the ingredient, an essential in the making of the steamed rice flour cake dish, would come on top of others. </p>

    <p>Speaking to CNA at her stall at Bendemeer Market and Food Centre on Wednesday, Ms Tan rattled off a list of ingredients that have become more expensive recently â€“ cooking oil, sugar, garlic and onions.</p>
